## 🎯 Challenge 5: Test Each Coding Agent

**Goal:** Run the same task with each agent and compare results.

### Task: List Files in Current Directory

**Claude Code:**
```bash
codemie-claude
```
```bash
List all files in the current directory with their sizes
```

**OpenAI Codex:**
Switch model for Codex:
```bash
codemie-codex --model gpt-4.1
```
```bash
List all files in the current directory with their sizes
```

**Google Gemini CLI:**
Switch model for Gemini:
```bash
codemie-gemini --model gemini-2.5-flash
```
```bash
List all files in the current directory with their sizes
```

### Compare Results

Observe differences in:
- Response speed
- Output format
- Level of explanation
- Code examples provided

**✅ Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Built-in agent responded
- [ ] Claude Code responded
- [ ] Codex responded
- [ ] Gemini responded
- [ ] Noted differences between agents

**🏆 Bonus:**
- Document which agent you prefer for different tasks
- Try a more complex prompt with each agent

## 🎯 Challenge 6: View Usage Analytics

**Goal:** Monitor your AI usage and costs.

### View Overall Usage

```bash
codemie analytics show
```

Shows:
- Total requests
- Success/failure rates
- Token usage
- Average response time

### Filter by Agent

```bash
codemie analytics show --agent claude
codemie analytics show --agent codex
codemie analytics show --agent gemini
```

### Filter by Date Range

```bash
# Filter from
codemie analytics show --from 2025-12-12
```

### View Detailed Statistics

```bash
# Verbose output with raw model names
codemie analytics show --verbose

# JSON format for external tools
codemie analytics show --format json

# Export to file
codemie analytics show --format json --output usage-report.json
```

**✅ Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Viewed overall usage statistics
- [ ] Filtered usage by specific agent
- [ ] Checked usage for a date range
- [ ] Exported analytics to JSON file
- [ ] Understand your usage patterns

**🏆 Bonus:**
- Compare usage between different agents
