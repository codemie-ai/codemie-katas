description: >
  A comprehensive hands-on Kata for developers to master the CodeMie Code CLI—a unified
  command-line interface that orchestrates multiple AI coding agents (Claude Code, OpenAI Codex,
  Google Gemini, and custom agents) from a single terminal. Learn to configure multi-provider
  setups (OpenAI, Azure, AWS Bedrock, Google, Enterprise SSO), automate code reviews and
  refactoring, integrate with CI/CD pipelines, track usage analytics, and boost productivity
  with advanced file operations and git integration. Perfect for developers seeking a powerful,
  enterprise-ready alternative to GitHub Copilot or Cursor with full control over multiple AI
  providers and agents.
