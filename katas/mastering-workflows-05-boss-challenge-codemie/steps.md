## 🎯 Boss Challenge: Intelligent Jira Ticket Analysis

**🔎 Overview**

Build a comprehensive Jira ticket analysis workflow that automatically categorizes and analyzes tickets based on their status, providing different insights for different work stages. This workflow demonstrates mastery of all advanced patterns in a real-world scenario.

**Goal**

Create an intelligent ticket analysis system that demonstrates:
- Fetching tickets from Jira using AI assistants with tool integration
- Iterating through ticket collections with context enrichment
- Conditional routing based on work stage classification
- Multi-path analysis with different strategies per status
- Comprehensive report generation with actionable insights

#### What This Challenge Tests

This is an integration challenge that combines:
- ✅ Multi-assistant orchestration (single specialized assistant used across states)
- ✅ Tool node integration (Jira API via generic_jira_tool)
- ✅ Iteration over collections (processing multiple tickets)
- ✅ Conditional branching (switch/cases based on work_stage)
- ✅ Dynamic value resolution (template variables in prompts)
- ✅ Complex state transitions (fetch → enrich → route → analyze → report)
- ✅ Report generation (comprehensive markdown summary)

**Instructions**

Build a workflow that analyzes Jira tickets with intelligent routing:

1. **Fetch Tickets** (Assistant with Tool Integration):
   - Create assistant `jira_assistant` with `generic_jira_tool`
   - Fetch last 10 tickets assigned to a specific user
   - Extract fields: key, summary, issuetype, status
   - Return structured JSON with tickets array
   - Set up iteration with `iter_key: tickets`

2. **Enrich Ticket Data** (Classification):
   - For each ticket, determine the work stage:
     - "not_started" - Open, To Do, Backlog
     - "in_progress" - In Progress, In Development, In Review
     - "other" - Completed, Done, Closed
   - Use `resolve_dynamic_values_in_prompt: true` to access ticket variables
   - Return enriched JSON with work_stage field

3. **Route by Work Stage** (Conditional Branching):
   - Create `route-by-work-stage` state with switch logic
   - Define cases:
     - `work_stage == 'not_started'` → analyze-opened-ticket
     - `work_stage == 'in_progress'` → estimate-in-progress-ticket
     - Default → skip-ticket
   - Use `meta_next_state_id` and `meta_iter_state_id` for proper routing

4. **Multi-Path Analysis** (Different Analysis Strategies):

   **Path 1 - Not Started Tickets:**
   - Provide task breakdown with what needs to be done
   - List 3-5 key steps to complete the task
   - Identify potential challenges or blockers

   **Path 2 - In Progress Tickets:**
   - Estimate time to completion (hours)
   - Provide confidence level (high/medium/low)
   - Give brief reasoning for the estimate

   **Path 3 - Other Tickets:**
   - Mark as skipped with appropriate message
   - Indicate ticket is not actionable

5. **Generate Final Report** (Aggregation & Reporting):
   - Create comprehensive markdown report with sections:
     - Overview with ticket breakdown
     - Not Started Tickets with task breakdowns
     - In Progress Tickets with time estimates
     - Total Estimated Work summary
     - Action Items & Recommendations
   - Use emojis and clear formatting for readability

**Workflow Flow**

```
fetch-tickets (fetch 10 tickets)
    ↓
enrich-ticket (classify work_stage) [iterate each ticket]
    ↓
route-by-work-stage (switch on work_stage)
    ↓
    ├→ analyze-opened-ticket (task breakdown)
    ├→ estimate-in-progress-ticket (time estimate)
    └→ skip-ticket (not actionable)
    ↓
generate-report (comprehensive summary)
```

**Success Checklist**

- [ ] Fetches tickets from Jira using assistant with tool integration
- [ ] Demonstrates iteration over ticket collection with `iter_key`
- [ ] Enriches each ticket with work_stage classification
- [ ] Implements conditional branching (switch/cases) based on work_stage
- [ ] Routes to 3 different analysis paths (not_started, in_progress, skip)
- [ ] Uses `resolve_dynamic_values_in_prompt` for dynamic context access
- [ ] Uses `meta_iter_state_id` and `meta_next_state_id` for proper state management
- [ ] Provides different analysis for each work stage
- [ ] Generates comprehensive final report with structured sections
- [ ] Workflow handles real-world complexity with multiple state transitions

**Hints**

- Start by mapping out your workflow on paper before implementing
- Use `output_schema` consistently to maintain structured data flow
- Test each branch of your conditional logic

- Consider error cases and edge conditions
- Document your workflow purpose and logic

#### Solution

This solution demonstrates a production-ready workflow that combines all patterns: iteration, conditional branching, tool integration, dynamic templating, and comprehensive reporting.

## 💡 Tips & Best Practices

- **Atomic States**: Design each state to perform one clear logical action
- **Context Store**: Use variables like `{{key}}` to transfer data between steps
- **Transitions**: Master `next`, `switch`, `iter_key` for flow control
- **Structured Output**: Always define `output_schema` for clarity
- **Descriptive IDs**: Use clear, meaningful state and assistant IDs
- **Testing**: Test each branch and edge case before production
