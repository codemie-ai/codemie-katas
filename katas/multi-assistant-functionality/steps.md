## 🎯 Challenge 1: Understand Multi-Assistant Architecture

**Goal:** Learn how orchestrator and sub-assistants work together to solve complex tasks

### What is Multi-Assistant Functionality?

Let's start by understanding the power of multi-assistant systems.

The Multi-Assistant functionality is a sophisticated feature in AI/Run CodeMie platform designed to enhance agent-to-agent communications and facilitate the customization and management of AI-powered assistants tailored to work together on specific use cases. This feature allows users to craft personalized assistants with diverse properties, integrate powerful tools, and manage interactions within Assistants to resolve a chain of tasks or cover multipurpose requests —all within an intuitive interface. The Multi-Assistant introduces an innovative framework where one **Orchestrator Assistant** manages and delegates work to multiple **Sub Assistants**. Think of it as a project manager coordinating a team of specialists.

**How it Works:**
All interaction is done within the chat with the Orchestrator (so called multi-assistants chat):
1. **User** → Sends request to **Orchestrator**
2. **Orchestrator** → Analyzes request and Sub Assistant descriptions
3. **Orchestrator** → Coordinates the workflow and calls relevant **Sub Assistant(s)**
4. **Sub Assistant(s)** → Process request using their tools and knowledge
5. **Orchestrator** → Summarizes all retrieved results and responds to **User**

**Key Benefits:**

✅ **Specialization**: Each sub-assistant excels in a specific domain
✅ **Modularity**: Easily add/remove specialists without changing others
✅ **Scalability**: Handle complex multi-domain tasks effortlessly
✅ **Maintainability**: Update individual specialists independently

### When to Use Multi-Assistant

✅ **Good Use Cases:**
- Tasks requiring multiple areas of expertise
- Workflows with specialized domains (coding + documentation + testing)
- Requests that combine different tools or data sources
- Scenarios where you want focused, expert responses

❌ **Not Ideal For:**
- Very simple, single-task requests
- Complex conditional logic with many branches
- Iterative workflows requiring state management across many steps

💼 **Real-World Example:**

Imagine asking: *"Create a Jira ticket for the new login feature and implement it in our GitHub repository"*

- **Business Analyst Assistant** (with Jira tool) creates a detailed Jira ticket with requirements
- **Developer Assistant** (with GitHub tool) implements the feature and creates a pull request
- **Orchestrator** coordinates both specialists and provides a unified response with ticket ID and PR link

**✅ Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Understand the Orchestrator and Sub Assistant roles
- [ ] Know how the multi-assistant's chat works
- [ ] Can identify good use cases for Multi-Assistant
- [ ] Understand limitations

---

## 🎯 Challenge 2: Learn the Golden Rules

**Goal:** Master the critical rules for configuring Multi-Assistant systems correctly

### The Golden Setup Rules

**Rule #1: Orchestrator Acts as Delegation Manager Only**
- ✅ Orchestrator should ONLY have Sub Assistants (no other tools/datasources)
- ❌ Don't add Jira, Slack, or any tools directly to Orchestrator
- 💡 Why? Sub Assistants already have tools; Orchestrator just delegates

**Rule #2: Orchestrators Cannot Be added as a Sub Assistants**
- ✅ Only simple assistants can be Sub Assistants
- ❌ Never add an Orchestrator Assistant as a Sub Assistant
- 💡 **Why?** Ensures clear hierarchy with Orchestrator as the primary managing entity

**Rule #3: Descriptive Names Matter**
- ✅ Sub Assistant descriptions must clearly state their role/tools/knowledge
- ❌ Avoid using vague or incomplete descriptions
- 💡 Why? Orchestrator selects Sub Assistants based on descriptions

### Key Tips for Sub Assistant Descriptions

Your descriptions should answer:
- **What does this assistant do?** (role/responsibility)
- **What tools does it use?** (integrations/capabilities)
- **What knowledge does it have?** (datasources/expertise areas)

**Good Example:**
```
"Python code reviewer with GitHub integration. Analyzes code for
PEP 8 compliance, security vulnerabilities, and performance issues.
Has access to internal coding standards documentation."
```

**Bad Example:**
```
"Helpful assistant that does coding stuff"
```

**Rule #4: Sub Assistant Selection Depends on Your Role**
- 💡 **Why?** Access control ensures proper assistant sharing and project boundaries

**For Regular Users (Non-Admins):**
- ✅ Can select Sub Assistants from **same project** as the Orchestrator
- ✅ Can select Sub Assistants from **Marketplace** (public assistants)
- ❌ Cannot select assistants from other projects

**For Administrators:**
- ✅ Can select Sub Assistants from **any project** on the platform
- ✅ Can select Sub Assistants from **Marketplace**
- ✅ Full access to all assistants across the organization

**📋 Configuration Checklist:**

Before creating your multi-assistant system, verify:
- [ ] Orchestrator has **no tools** (only sub assistants)
- [ ] Each sub assistant has a **clear, specific description mentioning role, tools, and knowledge**
- [ ] Sub assistants have **their own tools/datasources**
- [ ] No circular references (orchestrator not in sub assistants)

**✅ Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Understand which configurations should be present in Orchestrator
- [ ] Understand the importance of sub assistant descriptions
- [ ] Know where tools and datasources should be configured
- [ ] Understand sub assistant visibility rules

**🏆 Bonus:**
- Explain how the Orchestrator decides which Sub Assistant to call
- Think of a real scenario where Multi-Assistants would help your team

## 🎯 Challenge 3: Create Your Specialist Team

**Goal:** Set up or identify 2 specialized Sub Assistants for your team

### Instructions

Now, let's check it on practice!
First, think about the multi-assistant use case that would be relevant to your project needs or could help you with routine tasks.
Have you come up with some ideas? Now we need to prepare specialists to whom your Orchestrator will delegate work. You have two options for this:

**Option A: Use Existing Assistants from Marketplace**

1. **Open Marketplace** in CodeMie sidebar
2. **Find two specialized assistants** relevant to your work
- Verify that their description is filled in sufficiently
- Assure that the selected assistant does not contain any sub assistant
3. **Note their names** - you'll need them for the next challenge

**💡 Tip:** Check out Kata "Assistants Marketplace: Your Gateway to Ready-to-Use AI Solutions" for more details on exploring the Marketplace.

**Option B: Create Your Own Sub Assistants**

If you prefer creating custom specialists:

1. **Navigate to Assistants** → "+ Create Assistant"
