# Workflow Conditional Logic

Master conditional branching in CodeMie Workflows with switch/case and if-else patterns. Learn to build adaptive workflows that make decisions based on data and route execution through different paths for different scenarios.

**Prerequisites:** Complete **Mastering Workflows Pt. 1: Nodes & Building Blocks** and **Pt. 2: Iteration & Reporting** first to understand state management and data flow.

## 📝 Conditional Branching

**Conditionals** allow workflow logic to diverge based on output at runtime. This enables adaptive workflows that respond differently to different data conditions.

**Why use these?**
- Make workflows adaptive and context-sensitive
- Handle different scenarios with appropriate logic paths
- Provide tailored analysis based on data characteristics

**Use this when:**
When outcomes or processing paths should differ based on data attributes (e.g., ticket status, file type, priority level).

## 🎯 Challenge 1: Switch/Case - Adaptive Jira Task Analysis

**🔎 Overview**

Implement conditional logic that classifies Jira tickets by status and provides different analyses for each category (not_started, in_progress, completed). Learn how to create adaptive workflows with switch/case logic.

**Goal**

Build a workflow that demonstrates:
- Conditional branching using `switch` with `cases`
- Dynamic routing based on runtime data
- Multiple processing paths for different scenarios
- Adaptive analysis based on data attributes
- Using `meta_next_state_id` for switch references

**Instructions**

1. **Create assistant** `jira_processor`:
   - Configure with `generic_jira_tool`
   - Add system prompt for professional ticket analysis

2. **Create state** `fetch-ticket-details`:
   - Use `resolve_dynamic_values_in_prompt: true` to access `{{ticket_key}}`
   - Fetch full ticket details with all relevant fields
   - Return structured JSON with ticket information

3. **Create state** `categorize-status`:
   - Analyze the ticket status
   - Categorize into: "not_started", "in_progress", or "completed"
   - Return JSON with `status_category` field

4. **Create state** `route-by-status` with switch logic:
   - Define cases for each status category
   - Route to different handler states based on the category
   - Set default case for completed tickets

5. **Create handler states:**
   - `handle-not-started`: Provide task breakdown, key steps, effort estimate, prerequisites, risks
   - `handle-in-progress`: Provide progress assessment, remaining work, time estimate, blockers, recommendations
   - `handle-completed`: Provide completion summary and lessons learned

6. **Create state** `format-final-output`:
   - Format the analysis into a clear markdown report
   - Adapt the structure based on analysis type
   - Include all relevant sections for the specific status category

7. **Execute the workflow** with different ticket keys and verify different analysis paths

## 🎯 Challenge 2: If-Else - Priority-Based Task Routing

**🔎 Overview**

Build a simpler conditional workflow using if-else logic to route tasks based on priority level. Learn when to use if-else versus switch/case patterns.

**Goal**

Build a workflow that demonstrates:
- Simple if-else conditional branching
- Priority-based routing (high priority vs normal priority)
- Two-path decision logic
- Clear boolean conditions

**Instructions**

1. **Create assistant** `task_router`:
   - Configure with `generic_jira_tool`
   - Add system prompt for task prioritization

2. **Create state** `fetch-task`:
   - Fetch ticket details including priority field
   - Return JSON with task information

3. **Create state** `check-priority`:
   - Analyze the priority field
   - Determine if it's "high_priority" (High, Highest, Critical) or "normal" (Medium, Low, Lowest)
   - Return JSON with `priority_level` field

4. **Create state** `route-by-priority` with if-else logic:
   - Use condition: `priority_level == 'high_priority'`
   - Route to `handle-urgent-task` if true
   - Route to `handle-normal-task` if false (no explicit else needed)

5. **Create handler states:**
   - `handle-urgent-task`: Flag as urgent, provide immediate action plan
   - `handle-normal-task`: Add to regular queue, provide standard analysis

6. **Execute the workflow** with different priority tickets and verify routing

## 💡 Tips & Best Practices

- **Switch vs If-Else**: Use switch/case for 3+ paths, if-else for binary decisions
- **Clear Conditions**: Write explicit, testable conditions
- **Default Cases**: Always provide a default path in switch statements
- **Test All Paths**: Execute workflow with data that triggers each branch
