## 🎯 Challenge 1: Set Up Your Environment and SDK Client

**Goal:** Install dependencies and establish an authenticated connection to CodeMie services

### Instructions

Let's get your development environment ready for building Jira-integrated AI assistants.

1. **Install the CodeMie Python SDK**:
```bash
pip install codemie-sdk-python
```

2. **Create a configuration file** called `example.properties`:
```properties
codemie_api_domain=https://codemie.lab.epam.com/code-assistant-api
username=firstname_lastname@epam.com
password=your_password
auth_client_id=your_client_id
auth_realm_name=codemie-prod
auth_server_url=https://keycloak.eks-core.aws.main.edp.projects.epam.com/auth
verify_ssl=false
```

3. **Create your main script** called `jira_assistant.py`:
```python
import os
from configparser import ConfigParser
from codemie_sdk import CodeMieClient

# Load configuration
config = ConfigParser()
config_path = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), "example.properties")

with open(config_path) as f:
    config.read_string("[example]\n" + f.read())

props = dict(config.items("example"))

# Initialize the CodeMie client
client = CodeMieClient(
    codemie_api_domain=props["codemie_api_domain"],
    username=props["username"],
    password=props["password"],
    auth_client_id=props["auth_client_id"],
    auth_realm_name=props["auth_realm_name"],
    auth_server_url=props["auth_server_url"],
    verify_ssl=False,
)

print("✅ Connected to CodeMie!")
print(f"Token obtained: {client.token[:30]}...")
```

4. **Run your script**:
```bash
python jira_assistant.py
```

**✅ Success Criteria:**
- [ ] SDK installed successfully
- [ ] Configuration file created with credentials
- [ ] Script runs and prints connection confirmation
- [ ] Authentication token is displayed

**💡 Tip:** Keep your credentials secure! Never commit `example.properties` to version control.

## 🎯 Challenge 2: Create a Jira Integration

**Goal:** Configure and register a Jira integration with your CodeMie project

### Instructions

Now let's connect your Jira instance to CodeMie. You'll need your Jira credentials ready!

1. **Get your Jira API credentials**:
   - Jira instance URL (e.g., `https://your-company.atlassian.net`)
   - Your Jira email address
   - Generate an API token from [Atlassian API Tokens](https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens)

2. **Add integration creation code** to your script:
```python
import uuid
from codemie_sdk.models.integration import (
    Integration,
    CredentialTypes,
    CredentialValues,
    IntegrationType,
)

# Define your project
user_project="user_email@epam.com", # personal user project

# Create Jira integration configuration
jira_integration = Integration(
    project_name=user_project,
    credential_type=CredentialTypes.JIRA,
    credential_values=[
        CredentialValues(
            key="url",
            value="https://your-jira-instance.atlassian.net"
        ),
        CredentialValues(
            key="username",
            value="your-jira-email@example.com"
        ),
        CredentialValues(
            key="token",
            value="your-jira-api-token"
        ),
    ],
    alias=f"Demo Jira Integration {uuid.uuid4()}",
    setting_type=IntegrationType.USER,
)

# Create the integration
client.integrations.create(jira_integration)
print(f"✅ Jira integration created: {jira_integration.alias}")
```

3. **Verify the integration was created**:
```python
from time import sleep

# Wait for integration to be processed
sleep(5)

# Retrieve the integration by alias
integration = client.integrations.get_by_alias(
    jira_integration.alias,
    setting_type=jira_integration.setting_type
)
print(f"📋 Integration ID: {integration.id}")
print(f"📋 Integration Details: {integration}")
```

**✅ Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Jira integration created successfully
- [ ] Integration has a unique alias and ID
- [ ] Can retrieve integration by alias
- [ ] Integration details show your Jira URL

**🏆 Bonus:**
- Explore other credential types available: `CredentialTypes.GIT`, `CredentialTypes.CONFLUENCE`, `CredentialTypes.AZURE_DEVOPS`
- List all integrations: `client.integrations.list()`

**💡 Pro Tip:** The `uuid.uuid4()` in the alias ensures uniqueness when testing multiple times!

## 🎯 Challenge 3: Create a Jira Datasource

**Goal:** Configure a Jira datasource that filters issues using JQL (Jira Query Language)

### Instructions

Datasources define what data your AI assistant can access. Let's create one for your Jira issues!

1. **Import datasource models**:
```python
from codemie_sdk.models.datasource import JiraDataSourceRequest, DataSourceType
```

2. **Create a Jira datasource**:
```python
# Define your JQL query
# This example gets issues reported by the current user
jql_query = "reporter = currentUser()"

# Create datasource configuration
datasource_request = JiraDataSourceRequest(
    name="my_jira_issues",
    project_name=user_project,
    description="My personal Jira issues datasource",
    setting_id=integration.id,  # Link to the integration from Challenge 2
    jql=jql_query,
)

# Create the datasource
client.datasources.create(datasource_request)
print(f"✅ Datasource created: {datasource_request.name}")
print(f"📊 JQL Query: {jql_query}")
```

3. **Verify datasource creation**:
```python
# List datasources for your project
datasources = client.datasources.list(
    datasource_types=DataSourceType.JIRA,
    projects=user_project
)

# Find your datasource
my_datasource = next(
    (ds for ds in datasources if ds.name == datasource_request.name),
    None
)

if my_datasource:
    print(f"✅ Datasource verified: {my_datasource.id}")
    print(f"📋 Description: {my_datasource.description}")
```

**✅ Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Datasource created and linked to Jira integration
- [ ] JQL query is configured
- [ ] Can retrieve datasource from the list
- [ ] Datasource has a valid ID

**🏆 Bonus:**
- Try different JQL queries:
  - `"project = MYPROJECT AND status = 'In Progress'"`
  - `"assignee = currentUser() AND status != Done"`
  - `"created >= -7d"` (issues from last 7 days)
- Create multiple datasources for different issue filters

**💡 Pro Tip:** Test your JQL queries in Jira's search interface before using them in your datasource!

1. **Import assistant models**:
```python
from time import sleep
from codemie_sdk.models.assistant import (
    AssistantCreateRequest,
    Context,
    ContextType,
)
```

2. **Get a prebuilt assistant as a template**:
```python
# Get list of prebuilt assistants
prebuilt_assistants = client.assistants.get_prebuilt()

# Use the first prebuilt assistant as a base
prebuilt_assistant = prebuilt_assistants[0]
print(f"📋 Using prebuilt assistant: {prebuilt_assistant.name}")
```

3. **Create your Jira-integrated assistant**:
```python
# Configure assistant with Jira datasource
assistant_name = "My Jira Assistant"
assistant_slug = f"{assistant_name} {uuid.uuid4()}"

assistant_request = AssistantCreateRequest(
    name=assistant_name,
    slug=assistant_slug,
    description="An AI assistant with access to my Jira issues",
    system_prompt="""You are a helpful Jira assistant. You have access to
    Jira issues and can help users understand their projects, track progress,
    and provide insights about issue status and workflows. Always provide
    clear and actionable information.""",
    llm_model_type="gpt-5-2025-08-07",
    project=user_project,
    toolkits=prebuilt_assistant.toolkits,
    temperature=0.7,
    top_p=prebuilt_assistant.top_p,
    # Link the Jira datasource
    context=[
        Context(
            name=datasource_request.name,
            context_type=ContextType.CODE,
        )
    ],
)

# Create the assistant
create_response = client.assistants.create(assistant_request)

print(f"\n🎉 Assistant Created!")
print(f"  Response: {create_response}")

# Wait for assistant to be fully created
print("⏳ Waiting for assistant to be fully created...")
sleep(5)

# Retrieve all assistants and find ours by name
assistants = client.assistants.list(
    minimal_response=True,
    scope="visible_to_user",
    per_page=50
)

assistant = next((a for a in assistants if a.name == assistant_name), None)

if not assistant:
    raise Exception("Could not find newly created assistant")

assistant_id = assistant.id

print(f"  Assistant ID: {assistant_id}")
print(f"  Name: {assistant.name}")

# Get full details
full_assistant = client.assistants.get(assistant_id)
print(f"  Slug: {full_assistant.slug}")
print(f"✅ Assistant verified with {len(full_assistant.context)} context source(s)")
```

**✅ Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Assistant created successfully
- [ ] Assistant is linked to Jira datasource via context
- [ ] Assistant has a custom system prompt
- [ ] Can retrieve assistant by slug

**🏆 Bonus:**
- Customize the system prompt for specific use cases (sprint planning, bug triage, etc.)

## 🎯 Challenge 6: Clean Up Resources

**Goal:** Properly delete resources when done testing

### Instructions

Good practice: always clean up test resources to avoid clutter!

1. **Delete the assistant**:
```python
# Delete assistant
print(f"\n🗑️  Deleting assistant: {assistant.name}")
client.assistants.delete(assistant_id)
print(f"   ✅ Deleted assistant (ID: {assistant_id})")

# Verify deletion
remaining_assistants = client.assistants.list(
    minimal_response=True,
    scope="visible_to_user",
    per_page=50
)

deleted_assistant = not any(a.id == assistant_id for a in remaining_assistants)
print(f"{'✅' if deleted_assistant else '❌'} Assistant deletion confirmed: {deleted_assistant}")
```

2. **Delete the datasource**:
```python
# Find datasource by name and delete
datasources = client.datasources.list(
    datasource_types=DataSourceType.JIRA,
    projects=user_project
)
datasource = next(
    (ds for ds in datasources if ds.name == datasource_request.name),
    None
)

if datasource:
    print(f"\n🗑️  Deleting datasource: {datasource.name}")
    client.datasources.delete(datasource.id)
    print(f"   ✅ Deleted datasource (ID: {datasource.id})")
```

3. **Delete the integration**:
```python
# Delete integration
print(f"\n🗑️  Deleting integration: {integration.id}")
client.integrations.delete(integration.id, integration.setting_type)
print(f"   ✅ Deleted integration")
```

**✅ Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Assistant deleted successfully
- [ ] Datasource deleted successfully
- [ ] Integration deleted successfully
- [ ] No orphaned resources remain

**💡 Pro Tip:** In production, you typically keep assistants and datasources running. Only delete during testing/development!
