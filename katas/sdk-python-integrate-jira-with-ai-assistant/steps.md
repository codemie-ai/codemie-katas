```properties
codemie_api_domain=https://codemie.lab.epam.com/code-assistant-api
username=firstname_lastname@epam.com
password=your_password
auth_client_id=your_client_id
auth_realm_name=codemie-prod
auth_server_url=https://keycloak.eks-core.aws.main.edp.projects.epam.com/auth
verify_ssl=false
```

3. **Create your main script** called `jira_assistant.py`:
```python
import os
from configparser import ConfigParser
from codemie_sdk import CodeMieClient

# Load configuration
config = ConfigParser()
config_path = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), "example.properties")

with open(config_path) as f:
    config.read_string("[example]\n" + f.read())

props = dict(config.items("example"))

# Initialize the CodeMie client
client = CodeMieClient(
    codemie_api_domain=props["codemie_api_domain"],
    username=props["username"],
    password=props["password"],
    auth_client_id=props["auth_client_id"],
    auth_realm_name=props["auth_realm_name"],
    auth_server_url=props["auth_server_url"],
    verify_ssl=False,
)

print("✅ Connected to CodeMie!")
print(f"Token obtained: {client.token[:30]}...")
```

1. **Get your Jira API credentials**:
   - Jira instance URL (e.g., `https://your-company.atlassian.net`)
   - Your Jira email address
   - Generate an API token from [Atlassian API Tokens](https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens)

2. **Add integration creation code** to your script:
```python
import uuid
from codemie_sdk.models.integration import (
    Integration,
    CredentialTypes,
    CredentialValues,
    IntegrationType,
)

# Define your project
user_project = "demo"

# Create Jira integration configuration
jira_integration = Integration(
    project_name=user_project,
    credential_type=CredentialTypes.JIRA,
    credential_values=[
        CredentialValues(
            key="url",
            value="https://your-jira-instance.atlassian.net"
        ),
        CredentialValues(
            key="username",
            value="your-jira-email@example.com"
        ),
        CredentialValues(
            key="token",
            value="your-jira-api-token"
        ),
    ],
    alias=f"Demo Jira Integration {uuid.uuid4()}",
    setting_type=IntegrationType.USER,
)

# Create the integration
client.integrations.create(jira_integration)
print(f"✅ Jira integration created: {jira_integration.alias}")
```

3. **Verify the integration was created**:
```python
from time import sleep

# Wait for integration to be processed
sleep(5)

# Retrieve the integration by alias
integration = client.integrations.get_by_alias(
    jira_integration.alias,
    setting_type=jira_integration.setting_type
)
print(f"📋 Integration ID: {integration.id}")
print(f"📋 Integration Details: {integration}")
```

**✅ Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Jira integration created successfully
- [ ] Integration has a unique alias and ID
- [ ] Can retrieve integration by alias
- [ ] Integration details show your Jira URL

**🏆 Bonus:**
- Explore other credential types available: `CredentialTypes.GIT`, `CredentialTypes.CONFLUENCE`, `CredentialTypes.AZURE_DEVOPS`
- List all integrations: `client.integrations.list()`

**💡 Pro Tip:** The `uuid.uuid4()` in the alias ensures uniqueness when testing multiple times!

## 🎯 Challenge 3: Create a Jira Datasource

**Goal:** Configure a Jira datasource that filters issues using JQL (Jira Query Language)

### Instructions

Datasources define what data your AI assistant can access. Let's create one for your Jira issues!

1. **Import datasource models**:
```python
from codemie_sdk.models.datasource import JiraDataSourceRequest, DataSourceType
```

2. **Create a Jira datasource**:
```python
# Define your JQL query
# This example gets issues reported by the current user
jql_query = "reporter = currentUser()"

# Create datasource configuration
datasource_request = JiraDataSourceRequest(
    name="my_jira_issues",
    project_name=user_project,
    description="My personal Jira issues datasource",
    setting_id=integration.id,  # Link to the integration from Challenge 2
    jql=jql_query,
)

# Create the datasource
client.datasources.create(datasource_request)
print(f"✅ Datasource created: {datasource_request.name}")
print(f"📊 JQL Query: {jql_query}")
```

3. **Verify datasource creation**:
```python
# List datasources for your project
datasources = client.datasources.list(
    datasource_types=DataSourceType.JIRA,
    projects=user_project
)

# Find your datasource
my_datasource = next(
    (ds for ds in datasources if ds.name == datasource_request.name),
    None
)

if my_datasource:
    print(f"✅ Datasource verified: {my_datasource.id}")
    print(f"📋 Description: {my_datasource.description}")
```

**✅ Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Datasource created and linked to Jira integration
- [ ] JQL query is configured
- [ ] Can retrieve datasource from the list
- [ ] Datasource has a valid ID

**🏆 Bonus:**
- Try different JQL queries:
  - `"project = MYPROJECT AND status = 'In Progress'"`
  - `"assignee = currentUser() AND status != Done"`
  - `"created >= -7d"` (issues from last 7 days)
- Create multiple datasources for different issue filters

**💡 Pro Tip:** Test your JQL queries in Jira's search interface before using them in your datasource!

---

## 🎯 Challenge 4: Create an AI Assistant with Jira Context

**Goal:** Build an AI assistant that has access to your Jira datasource

### Instructions

1. **Import assistant models**:
```python
from codemie_sdk.models.assistant import (
    AssistantCreateRequest,
    Context,
    ContextType,
)
```

2. **Get a prebuilt assistant as a template**:
```python
# Get list of prebuilt assistants
prebuilt_assistants = client.assistants.get_prebuilt()

# Use the first prebuilt assistant as a base
prebuilt_assistant = prebuilt_assistants[0]
print(f"📋 Using prebuilt assistant: {prebuilt_assistant.name}")
```

3. **Create your Jira-integrated assistant**:
```python
# Configure assistant with Jira datasource
assistant_name = "My Jira Assistant"
assistant_slug = f"{assistant_name} {uuid.uuid4()}"

assistant_request = AssistantCreateRequest(
    name=assistant_name,
    slug=assistant_slug,
    description="An AI assistant with access to my Jira issues",
    system_prompt="""You are a helpful Jira assistant. You have access to
    Jira issues and can help users understand their projects, track progress,
    and provide insights about issue status and workflows. Always provide
    clear and actionable information.""",
    llm_model_type="gpt-4o",
    project=user_project,
    toolkits=prebuilt_assistant.toolkits,
    temperature=0.7,
    top_p=prebuilt_assistant.top_p,
    # Link the Jira datasource
    context=[
        Context(
            name=datasource_request.name,
            context_type=ContextType.CODE,
        )
    ],
)

# Create the assistant

- Test edge cases like empty results or invalid queries

---

## 🎯 Challenge 6: Clean Up Resources

**Goal:** Properly delete resources when done testing

### Instructions

Good practice: always clean up test resources to avoid clutter!

1. **Delete the assistant**:
```python
# Delete assistant (optional - keep if you want to use it)
client.assistants.delete(assistant.id)
print(f"🗑️  Deleted assistant: {assistant.name}")
```

2. **Delete the datasource**:
```python
# Find datasource by name and delete
datasources = client.datasources.list(
    datasource_types=DataSourceType.JIRA,
    projects=user_project
)
datasource = next(
    (ds for ds in datasources if ds.name == datasource_request.name),
    None
)

if datasource:
    client.datasources.delete(datasource.id)
    print(f"🗑️  Deleted datasource: {datasource.name}")
```

3. **Delete the integration**:
```python
# Delete integration
client.integrations.delete(integration.id, integration.setting_type)
print(f"🗑️  Deleted integration: {integration.id}")
```

**✅ Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Assistant deleted successfully
- [ ] Datasource deleted successfully
- [ ] Integration deleted successfully
- [ ] No orphaned resources remain

**💡 Pro Tip:** In production, you typically keep assistants and datasources running. Only delete during testing/development!

## 🎯 Challenge 7: Chat with Pydantic Output Schema

**Goal:** Structure assistant responses using Pydantic models for type-safe, validated outputs

### Instructions

Output schemas allow you to enforce structured responses from your AI assistant. Pydantic schemas provide automatic validation and type checking!

1. **Import Pydantic BaseModel**:
```python
from pydantic import BaseModel
```

2. **Define a simple Pydantic schema for Jira issue summary**:
```python
# Simple schema - list of issue keys
class IssueKeysSchema(BaseModel):
    issue_keys: list[str]

# Ask assistant to list issues in structured format
chat_request = AssistantChatRequest(
    text="List all Jira issue keys from my datasource",
    stream=False,
    output_schema=IssueKeysSchema  # Pass the Pydantic class
)

response = client.assistants.chat(assistant.id, chat_request)

# Response is now structured according to schema
print(f"📋 Issue Keys: {response.issue_keys}")
for key in response.issue_keys:
    print(f"  - {key}")
```

3. **Define a nested Pydantic schema for detailed issue information**:
```python
# Nested schema with complex structure
class JiraUser(BaseModel):
    name: str
    email: str | None = None

class JiraIssue(BaseModel):
    key: str
    summary: str
    status: str
    priority: str
    assignee: JiraUser | None = None

class JiraIssuesResponse(BaseModel):
    total_count: int
    issues: list[JiraIssue]

# Ask for detailed structured information
chat_request = AssistantChatRequest(
    text="Provide detailed information about my Jira issues including assignee details",
    stream=False,
    output_schema=JiraIssuesResponse
)

response = client.assistants.chat(assistant.id, chat_request)

print(f"\n📊 Total Issues: {response.total_count}")
for issue in response.issues:
    print(f"\n🎫 {issue.key}: {issue.summary}")
    print(f"   Status: {issue.status}")
    print(f"   Priority: {issue.priority}")
    if issue.assignee:
        print(f"   Assignee: {issue.assignee.name}")
```

**✅ Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Simple Pydantic schema returns structured list
- [ ] Nested Pydantic schema with complex objects works
- [ ] Response fields are automatically validated
- [ ] Can access response attributes directly (e.g., `response.issue_keys`)

**🏆 Bonus:**
- Add field validators using Pydantic's `@validator` decorator
- Try optional fields with default values
- Experiment with `Field()` for descriptions and constraints

**💡 Pro Tip:** Pydantic schemas provide automatic type checking and validation - invalid responses will raise errors before you access the data!

---

## 🎯 Challenge 8: Chat with JSON Schema

**Goal:** Use JSON Schema for flexible, dictionary-based structured outputs

### Instructions

JSON schemas provide a standard way to define data structures without Pydantic dependencies. Perfect for dynamic schemas!

1. **Define a simple JSON schema for issue statistics**:
```python
# Simple JSON schema
simple_schema = {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
        "open_count": {
            "type": "integer",
            "description": "Number of open issues"
        },
        "in_progress_count": {
            "type": "integer",
            "description": "Number of in-progress issues"
        },
        "done_count": {
            "type": "integer",
            "description": "Number of completed issues"
        }
    },
    "required": ["open_count", "in_progress_count", "done_count"]
}

# Use JSON schema in chat request
chat_request = AssistantChatRequest(
    text="Analyze my Jira issues and provide counts by status",
    stream=False,
    output_schema=simple_schema  # Pass the dictionary
)

response = client.assistants.chat(assistant.id, chat_request)

# Response is a dictionary matching the schema
print("\n📈 Issue Statistics:")
print(f"  Open: {response['open_count']}")
print(f"  In Progress: {response['in_progress_count']}")
print(f"  Done: {response['done_count']}")
total = response['open_count'] + response['in_progress_count'] + response['done_count']
print(f"  Total: {total}")
```

2. **Define a nested JSON schema with complex objects**:
```python
# Nested JSON schema with arrays and objects
nested_schema = {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
        "summary": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "total_issues": {"type": "integer"},
                "report_date": {"type": "string"},
                "project_name": {"type": "string"}
            },
            "required": ["total_issues", "report_date"]
        },
        "issues_by_priority": {
            "type": "array",
            "items": {
                "type": "object",
                "properties": {
                    "priority": {"type": "string"},
                    "count": {"type": "integer"},
                    "issues": {
                        "type": "array",
                        "items": {
                            "type": "object",
                            "properties": {
                                "key": {"type": "string"},
                                "title": {"type": "string"}
                            },
                            "required": ["key", "title"]
                        }
                    }
                },
                "required": ["priority", "count", "issues"]
            }
        }
    },
    "required": ["summary", "issues_by_priority"]
}

# Request detailed report with nested structure
chat_request = AssistantChatRequest(
    text="Generate a comprehensive Jira report grouped by priority with issue details",
    stream=False,
    output_schema=nested_schema
)

response = client.assistants.chat(assistant.id, chat_request)

# Access nested dictionary structure
print(f"\n📋 Jira Report")
print(f"Date: {response['summary']['report_date']}")
print(f"Total Issues: {response['summary']['total_issues']}")

print("\n📊 Issues by Priority:")
for priority_group in response['issues_by_priority']:
    print(f"\n🔥 {priority_group['priority']}: {priority_group['count']} issues")
    for issue in priority_group['issues']:
        print(f"   - {issue['key']}: {issue['title']}")
```

**✅ Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Simple JSON schema returns valid dictionary
- [ ] Nested JSON schema with arrays and objects works
- [ ] Response matches defined schema structure
- [ ] Can access nested values using dictionary keys

**🏆 Bonus:**
- Add JSON schema constraints (minimum, maximum, pattern)
- Use `additionalProperties: false` to strictly enforce schema
- Try `enum` for fixed value lists
- Combine multiple schemas with `$ref` or `allOf`

**💡 Pro Tip:** JSON schemas are more flexible than Pydantic but require manual validation. Use them when you need dynamic schemas or interoperability with other systems!

**🔍 Key Differences:**
- **Pydantic**: Type-safe, validated objects with attribute access (`response.field`)
- **JSON Schema**: Flexible dictionaries with key access (`response['field']`)
- **Pydantic**: Better for Python-centric workflows
- **JSON Schema**: Better for language-agnostic APIs
