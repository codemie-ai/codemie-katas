## 🎯 Challenge 1: Create Your First Assistant from Scratch

**Goal:** Build a custom AI Assistant with your own configuration

### Instructions

Let's start by getting familiar with where everything lives in CodeMie.

1. Navigate to the **Assistants menu** in the left sidebar
   
2. Go to **Project Assistants** tab and **Find the "+ Create Assistant" button** in the top right corner

3. **Choose your creation method** in the popup:

![generate with AI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codemie-ai/codemie-katas/refs/heads/main/katas/create-your-ai-assistant-with-codemie/images/generate_with_AI.png)

**Option A: "Generate Assistant with AI"** - Describe your main idea and requirements for the assistant, then let the AI configure it for you.
   
If you select AI generation, the platform recommends features and tools (if selected to be included) that fit their goals, then automatically builds an assistant profile—including its name, description, conversation starters, and crucial system instructions. 
   
**Option B: "Create Manually"** - Configure everything yourself

**✨ For this challenge, select **"Create Manually"** to learn all the settings.**

4. **Configure Project Settings:**

**Project:** [Select your project]

**Shared with Project:** ☐ Unchecked (keep it private for now)

**📝 Note:** You can't share assistants that use personal integrations, and assistants can only be shared within one project.

5. **Fill in Basic Information:**

**Name:** A unique identifier you give to your Assistant.

**Slug:** A web-friendly version of the Name field used in URL links. It's automatically filled out based on the name using lowercase letters, hyphens (-) instead of spaces, and no special characters. You can adjust it manually if needed.

**📖Example**: If the Assistant's name is "Test Chatbot", the Slug will be automatically generated as "test-chatbot".

**Icon URL (Optional):** A link to an image (.png or .svg formats) that represents your Assistant. You can use your own icons (stored in SharePoint, a repository, or any accessible cloud storage) or copy links from any template on the AI/Run CodeMie platform.

**Description:** A brief explanation of the Assistant's purpose and functionality.

**Categories:** Choose up to 3 categories that describe your assistant's use case.

**Add Conversation Starters** (Optional): You can add up to four example questions that users will see when they begin chatting with your Assistant. They help show users what kind of questions they can ask and how to begin the interaction effectively.

**📖Example**: "Create a to-do list from this meeting notes"

6. **Configure Behavior & Logic:**

**System Instructions:** A prompt that guides how the Assistant interprets and responds to user queries.

👉 Use the **Generate with AI** functionality. Find corresponding button in the top of **System instructions** section, click on it and provide a description of your assistant's goals and behavior, then the AI will generate system instructions for you.

👉 As an alternative, you can find the **Prompt Engineer Assistant** in the Marketplace or in the left sidebar. Use this assistant to create, refine, and optimize prompts for LLMs or LLM-driven AI Assistants. It provides predefined prompt structures and applies best practices automatically, handling both simple and complex instructions. Use this Assistant to save time and improve the quality of your system instructions.

**LLM Model:** The list of all LLMs available in the AI/Run CodeMie. Choose the one that you want to use for your Assistant.

**Temperature(Optional):** Controls the output's randomness. A lower temperature makes the output more deterministic and focused, while a higher temperature increases diversity and variety in responses. If you want a neutral result, keep the temperature in the middle, around 0.5-1.

**Top P(Optional):** An alternative to Temperature that controls response variety by limiting the cumulative probability of word (token) choices.

7. **Context & Data Sources**

- **Datasource Context (Optional):** External data sources that your Assistant can reference when processing requests. You can add different types in data sources, including files of various formats (.pdf, .txt, .csv, and others), Google documents, Confluence pages and more.

- **Sub Assistants (Optional):** Here you're able to select specialized assistants to work under an orchestrator assistant.

📚 This feature will be covered in the Kata **"Master Multi-Assistant Orchestration: Build Your AI Team"**

8. **Available Tools (Optional):** This option allows you to significantly expand your Assistant's capabilities by enabling various tools from a toolset.

**Note:** Most tools demand the configuration of integrations in the Integrations menu first. They require more computing resources and may affect your Assistant's response time.

9. **Click "Create"** button at the bottom and observe your newly created assistant appeared in **Project Assistants** page

**✅ Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Successfully created an assistant
- [ ] Assistant appears in your Project Assistants tab

**🏆 Bonus Challenge:**
- Use the **"Generate Assistant with AI"** option to create another assistant — describe what you want and see how AI configures it!
