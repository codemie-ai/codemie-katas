## 🎯 Challenge 1: Revive an Underperforming Assistant

**Goal:** Transform an existing assistant's behavior by refining its system instructions with AI-powered suggestions

### Why This Matters

Every assistant's effectiveness lives or dies by its system instructions (the prompt). Even minor refinements can dramatically improve response quality, accuracy, and personality. The "Refine with AI" feature analyzes your current prompt and suggests improvements based on best practices—saving you hours of trial and error.

### Instructions

1. **Open an existing assistant** in your workspace that you'd like to improve:
   - Navigate to your assistants list
   - Choose an assistant that hasn't been performing as expected or has poor prompt
   - Or create a new assistant if you want to start fresh

2. **Access the edit page**:
   - Go on the assistant's edit page
   - Locate the **System Instructions** section (this is your assistant's prompt)

3. **Launch Refine with AI**:
   - Find the **"Refine with AI"** action button above the System Instructions section
   - Click it to open the refinement dialog

4. **Choose your refinement approach** (you have two options):

   **Option A - Guided Refinement:**
   - In the dialog, describe in natural language what you want to improve
   - Examples:
     - "Make responses more concise and technical"
     - "Add expertise in Python debugging"
     - "Improve tone to be more friendly and encouraging"
     - "Add structured output format with markdown"

   **Option B - Auto-Refinement:**
   - Leave the comment field empty
   - The AI will automatically optimize your prompt according to best practices
   - This works great when you're not sure what needs improvement

5. **Review and apply the results**:
   - Examine the suggested improvements if they align with your goals
   - Save the updated assistant

6. **Verify the improvements**:
   - Start a new chat with your refined assistant
   - Ask a question typical for its role
   - Compare the response quality to previous interactions
   - Pro tip: Keep a few test questions handy for consistent evaluation

7. **Use prompt history for safety**:
   - If the refinement didn't work as expected, don't worry!
   - Click on **"History"** near the System Instructions
   - Restore any previous version of your prompt with one click
   - Experiment freely knowing you can always roll back

**✅ Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Successfully opened and edited an existing assistant
- [ ] Used "Refine with AI" with either a specific request or auto-refinement
- [ ] Applied the AI-suggested improvements to system instructions
- [ ] Tested the refined assistant with relevant questions
- [ ] Located the prompt history/version feature for future rollbacks

**🏆 Bonus Challenge:**
- Refine 2-3 different assistants and compare the improvement strategies suggested by AI
- Try both guided refinement (with specific instructions) and auto-refinement on the same assistant to see the difference
- Document your "before and after" test results to measure improvement objectively

## 🎯 Challenge 2: Craft Expert Prompts with the Prompt Engineer

**Goal:** Create professional-grade assistant prompts using conversational AI guidance from the Prompt Engineer assistant

### Why This Matters

Creating prompts from scratch can be intimidating. Should you be formal or casual? How much context is too much? What formatting works best? The **Prompt Engineer assistant** is your expert consultant—it asks the right questions, considers your use case, and generates optimized prompts through natural conversation.

### Instructions

1. **Find the Prompt Engineer assistant**:
   - Look in your sidebar under default or recommended assistants
   - Or visit the Marketplace (it's usually on the first page—it's that popular!)
   - Search for "Prompt Engineer" if needed

2. **Start a conversation about your needs**:
   - Open a chat with Prompt Engineer
   - Describe your ideal assistant in natural language
   - Be specific about the role, tasks, and desired behavior

   **Example conversation starters:**
   - "I need a research agent that generates daily summaries of AI news from around the world"
   - "Create a code reviewer assistant that focuses on security vulnerabilities and performance"
   - "Help me build a customer support agent for a SaaS product with empathetic tone"
   - "I want a data analyst assistant that explains insights in simple business terms"

3. **Leverage multimodal capabilities** (optional but powerful):
   - Upload screenshots of your desired output format
   - Share example conversations or documents that represent your use case
   - Provide sample data files that your assistant will work with
   - The Prompt Engineer considers all these inputs when crafting your prompt

4. **Refine through conversation**:
   - Review the initial prompt suggestion
   - Ask for adjustments: "Make it more technical" or "Add examples for edge cases"
   - Request different versions: "Give me a version optimized for speed" or "Create a variant with more personality"
   - The Prompt Engineer is conversational—treat it like a brainstorming partner

5. **Test and iterate**:
   - Copy the final prompt version
   - Create a new assistant or update an existing one with this prompt
   - Test it with real queries
   - Return to Prompt Engineer if you need further refinement

6. **Apply your learnings**:
   - Notice the patterns in well-crafted prompts (structure, tone, specificity)
   - Use these insights when manually editing prompts in the future

**✅ Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Located and opened the Prompt Engineer assistant
- [ ] Described a specific assistant need in natural language
- [ ] Received a custom prompt suggestion from Prompt Engineer
- [ ] Iterated on the prompt with at least one refinement request
- [ ] Applied the final prompt to create or update an assistant
- [ ] Tested the new assistant with relevant questions

**🏆 Bonus Challenge:**
- Upload an image or document to Prompt Engineer and see how it incorporates that context
- Create prompts for 2-3 different assistant types (e.g., technical, creative, analytical)
- Compare prompts created by Prompt Engineer vs. "Refine with AI" on the same assistant concept
- Share your best prompt with team members and document what makes it effective
